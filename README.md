# Series List

Personal Project to Learn KOTLIN

GOALS:
- Use Retrofit to call API (Maybe IMDB or other TV Series API)
- Live Data / Mutable Live Data concepts + ROOM to store SQLite
- Espresso for Android Testing (Learn if it works with Kotlin)
- Glide / Picasso for Image Handling
- Work with Fragments
- ButterKnife or Bind Annotations 

Screens:

- User profile with name / email / Photo (Maybe)
- Favorites list (Max 10)
- Home with all series (Ordered by most watched / trending)

Stories:

- The user must be able to mark that episode as watched or at least the last watched on the series.
- The user must be able to add that series to the favorites list.
- Each series must have its episode names and maybe the synopsis of the episode.
